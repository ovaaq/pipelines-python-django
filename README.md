# Recipe Generator

Final project for the Building AI course is going to be recipe based Deep learnign network.

## Summary

I am going to calculate flavor profiles that add up and then you let neural network create a recipe with few input incredients.

## Background

I am passionate about making food and creating new recipes. 

## How is it used?

It is used to generate new recipes. Mainly for me to try, but also there would be a website for others.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data has to be collected. There is data in cookbooks and so on, but you have to digitalize it and uniform it.

## Challenges

This might create controversial recipes where some cultures might not approve.

## What next?

I need platform to others contribute their favourite recipes!
